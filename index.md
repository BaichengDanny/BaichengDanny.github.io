# About Me

<img src="https://baichengdanny.github.io/danny.jpg?raw=true" class="floatpic" width="360" height="480">



Hi! This is **Baicheng Chen (Danny, ÈôàÊüèÊàê)**.

I am a sophomore majoring in **CSE** at the School of Data Science, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHK-Shenzhen). In our university, I'm also a student at Minerva College (ÂéöÂê´‰π¶Èô¢). Furthermore, I'm a video Editor and Colorist working in the Student Union currently (You can follow the [Bilibili account of the Student Unionüîó](https://space.bilibili.com/508002687) to watch our works).

I have learned several programming languages like C++, Java, Python and Go, familiar with lots of commonly used Python libraries such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib and sklearn. I also mastered the grammar of LaTex and Markdown. Moreover, in middle school, I used to attend NOIP programming contests and learned many Algorithms. The experience also triggers my interest in computer science and algorithms.

My hobbies include many fields.  Except for computer science and research, I like literature, music (singing and piano) and swimming. I'm interested in reading and thinking, empathizing with the characters in the book, and writing thoughts and experiences of me. 

If you are interested in any aspect of me, would like to chat with me further, please email me at *baichengchen[at]link[dot]cuhk[dot]edu[dot]cn*. I'm looking for like-minded people!

## Research Interests

- Machine Learning
- AI security and privacy
- Deepfake
- Federated Learning
- Computer Vision

My current research focuses on the **Deepfake Detection**. The course **Computer Security** I took in the summer  particularly impressed me by unfolding the severe consequences of private data being breached and the increasingly serious security issues in the rapid development of Al (e.g. deepfake) reinforcing my determination to learn how to solve these issues.

## News and Updates

- **April 2024:** My first paper "***Federated Learning-Based EfficientNet in Brain Tumor Classification***" is going to be published. In the last few months, I constantly worked on **Federated Learning** and its application in the **Computer Vision** field. Although this paper is just like an experiment report, I  really spent a lot of time and effort on it from zero. Importantly, I found the best way for me to study: to learn through trying forward an aim. 
- **March 2024:** I finished a great group project with my teammates (Boxuan Wen, Yeke Zhang and Zixiang Hao). Our project focuses on the ***Implementation of Image Classification Training Based on FedAvg Algorithm***. I had a great time with them! You can find our slides and report in the **Publication** section.
