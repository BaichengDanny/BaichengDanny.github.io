<img src="https://github.com/BaichengDanny/BaichengDanny.github.io/blob/main/danny.jpg?raw=true" class="floatpic" width="360" height="480">

Here is **Baicheng Chen (Danny, ÈôàÊüèÊàê)**.

I am a freshman majoring in **CSE** at the School of Data Science, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHK-Shenzhen). In our university, I'm also a student at Minerva College (ÂéöÂê´‰π¶Èô¢). Furthermore, I'm a video Editor and Colorist and working in the Student Union currently (You can follow the [Bilibili account of the Student Unionüîó](https://space.bilibili.com/508002687) to watch our works).

I have learned several programming languages like C++, Java and Python, familiar with lots of commonly used Python libraries such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib and sklearn. I also mastered the grammar of LaTex and Markdown. Moreover, in middle school, I used to attend NOIP programming contest and learned many Algorithms. The experience also triggers my interests of computer science and algorithms.

My hobbies include many fields.  Except for computer science and research, I like literature, music (singing and piano) and swimming. I'm interested in reading and thinking, empathizing with the characters in the book, and writing thoughts and experiences of me. 

If you are interested in any aspect of me, would like to chat with me further, please email me at - *baichengchen[dot]link[dot]cuhk[dot]edu[dot]cn*. I'm looking for like-minded people!

## Research Interests

- Machine Learning Algorithms
- Federated Learning
- High performance computing (HPC)
- Computer Vision

My current research focuses on the **Federated Learning**. In 2016, Google's researchers put forward a novel Machine Learning Architecture based on Distributed Machine Learning called Federated Learning (FL), which highly improved data privacy and security. Now, I'm researching the application of FL in the **computer vision** field. And next, I'll mainly focus on **Fully Distributed Federated Learning**.
